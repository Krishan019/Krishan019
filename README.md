# ðŸ’« About Me:
## Quantum Computing and Machine Learning Researcher at Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), New Delhi, India <br>

My name is Krishan Sharma, and I'm passionate about Quantum Computing and AI/ML research, exploring how these technologies can reshape the future of science and society. <br>

I have completed my Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India. I have also successfully qualified in India's prestigious national-level competitive examinations:Â IIT-JAM (Physics),Â GATE (Physics), andÂ GATE (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). <br>

Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving quantum-inspired optimization with QUBO and QAOA implementations, tackling problems such as vehicle routing using tools like Qiskit and D-Wave. I am also actively working on neuroimaging data with quantum machine learning, exploring the emerging field of quantum neurocomputing. Alongside this, I am expanding my expertise in AI/ML, quantum machine learning (QML), and high-performance computing to contribute to advancements in quantum technologies and their real-world applications. <br>

I enjoy working at the intersection of physics, quantum computation, and machine learning, constantly exploring cutting-edge technologies to stay ahead in this fast-evolving field. I love being part of this journey - always learning, discovering, and seeking the next big breakthrough in computational research. I believe every small effort matters as a step toward meaningful progress because itâ€™s about exploring the unknown, pushing boundaries, and turning possibilities into impact.
